I have taken several tests over the time for RA applications. Files here contain my codes and the outputs. As I'm the sort of person that learns by looking at examples. Very often, when I need to do something, I need to lookup an example of how I did it before, or how it's done. These tests serve this purpose.

Also, I believe the easiest way to learn something is to [dive](https://twitter.com/saidbyarshad/status/1545083381033369601) into it. That is how I have taught myself R.
